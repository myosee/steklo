Firstly, that deploy that was supposed to fix all the paths in the .html files in the "html" folder doesn't seem to be working, cuz i found that the same code changes leads to dif results. Could it be Git ping issue?

And after all we still have a broken "back to top" button. Is that JS issue? I think JS files are being read incorrectly or not at all :/
